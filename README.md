## Project Overview

Luttappi is structured as a modern JavaScript/Node.js web application. It leverages popular tools and patterns for frontend and backend development, with a focus on developer experience, code consistency, and extensibility.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (see `package.json` for compatible versions)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- (Optional) Environment variable configuration in `.env` file

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RMRanjit/Luttappi.git
   cd Luttappi
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if present, or use the `.env` template provided.
   - Edit the `.env` file with the required configuration.

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

## Project Structure

```
Luttappi/
├── .env               # Environment variables
├── .eslintrc.json     # ESLint configuration
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── public/            # Static assets (images, favicon, etc.)
└── src/               # Application source code
```

- **`public/`**: Static files served directly (e.g., HTML, images).
- **`src/`**: Main application source code (components, logic, styles, etc.).
- **`.env`**: Configuration for sensitive/environment-specific values.
- **`.eslintrc.json`**: Linting rules for code style and best practices.

---

## Design and Architecture

### 1. Modular Structure

- All functional code lives in `src/`, separated into logical modules (e.g., components, services, utils).
- Encourages reusability and easier testing.

### 2. Configuration Driven

- Uses environment variables from `.env` to manage sensitive or environment-specific settings.
- Keeps configuration out of code for flexibility and security.

### 3. Tooling

- **ESLint** for code quality and style enforcement (see `.eslintrc.json`).
- Scripts in `package.json` streamline common tasks (start, build, lint, test, etc.).

### 4. Extensibility

- The clean separation of static assets (`public/`) and application logic (`src/`) makes it straightforward to add functionality or swap technologies (e.g., switch frontend frameworks, add API endpoints).

---

## Configuration

- All runtime configuration should be specified in the `.env` file.
- Ensure you do **not** commit sensitive data; `.gitignore` includes `.env` by default.

---

## Development Workflow

1. **Branching:** Use feature branches for new work.
2. **Linting:** Run `npm run lint` before opening a PR.
3. **Testing:** (If tests are present) Run `npm test`.
4. **Pull Requests:** Ensure your code passes lint and tests before requesting review.

---

## Linting & Code Quality

- The project uses ESLint with rules defined in `.eslintrc.json`.
- Run the linter:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  # or
  yarn lint
  ```
